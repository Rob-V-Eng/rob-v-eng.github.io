title: Custom Metal Fixtures for Residential Renovation
description:  I designed a series of custom metal shelving units for a residential renovation, including a basement bar shelf, a floating glass shelf system in the dining area, and two shelving units in the lounge. Each piece was developed to match the interior design vision while remaining fully functional and practical for fabrication and installation. I handled the complete design workflow — from interpreting client concepts to creating shop drawings, coordinating revisions, and overseeing production.

skills: 
- SolidWorks (multi-part assemblies, welded structures, machined components)
- Laser-cut part detailing and nesting awareness
- Mixed-material integration (metal with glass and wood)
- Clean, concealed fastener design
- Bill of Materials creation and assembly sequencing
- Fabrication coordination and quality control
- Interpretation of interior design intent and translation into technical drawings

## Background & Objective
The renovation involved designing multiple feature shelving units to suit different spaces in the home. Each piece needed to reflect the style and layout of its environment while using consistent materials and finish quality. The work was coordinated through a third-party design firm who provided general concepts and specifications. My job was to take those concepts and turn them into detailed SolidWorks models and shop-ready drawings for fabrication.

The goal was to produce:

- A modern, functional bar shelf in the basement
- A light, visually minimal floating glass shelf system for the dining area
- Two wood-accented shelving units for the lounge that blended industrial and natural materials

## Design and Prototyping Process
### Basement Bar Shelf
- Constructed using laser-cut metal plates and flat bars for a minimalist, industrial aesthetic
- Designed for wall mounting, with hidden fasteners for a clean appearance
- Accounted for the weight of liquor bottles and accessories, ensuring adequate bracket support and mounting points
- Created access for concealed hardware and simplified the installation process during production planning

### Dining Area Floating Glass Shelf Unit
- This unit featured four staggered glass shelves supported by a floating metal structure
- The frame was built using different-sized metal tubes for variation in visual weight, along with machined brackets to hold the glass in place
- The design prioritized minimal visible hardware and clean lines, which required precision in the frame’s internal supports and joinery
- I carefully planned wire routing and alignment to ensure shelves stayed level and secure

### Lounge Area Wood & Metal Shelving Units
- These two units were fabricated from square metal tubing, laser-cut side panels, and flat bar supports, combined with wooden shelf panels
- I designed integrated notches and seatings for the wood inserts to ensure a flush fit and prevent visible fasteners
- The metal finish was selected to contrast the wood tones, creating a modern-rustic blend that matched the rest of the lounge decor
- I also ensured mounting brackets were recessed or hidden to keep the aesthetic clean from all visible angles

## Workflow Responsibilities
Across all three sub-projects, my role followed the same structured process:

**1. Client Concept Interpretation:** Received a design brief and reference sketches from the client’s architectural team.

**2. CAD Development in SolidWorks:** Modeled each unit in 3D, refined dimensions and tolerances, and ensured material compatibility and structural soundness.

**3. Client Review & Revisions:** Submitted assembly drawings for client approval; handled revision cycles smoothly with clear version control.

**4. Shop Drawing & BOM Creation:** Generated detailed part drawings, machining notes, welding instructions, and a full bill of materials for fabrication.

**5. Fabrication Coordination & QA:** Released drawings to production, communicated with the shop on fabrication details, and performed final checks for quality and accuracy before delivery.

## Outcomes & Impact 
- Delivered five unique custom-built shelving units with aesthetic and structural integrity
- Successfully translated architectural design intent into functional, manufacturable products
- Helped streamline shop floor fabrication by delivering complete, accurate drawings
- Improved installation ease by designing around real-world mounting constraints and finish standards
- Showed adaptability across interior spaces — from industrial bar settings to refined lounge areas
