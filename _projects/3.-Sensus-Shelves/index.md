title: Custom Metal Fixtures for Residential Renovation
description:  I designed and supported the production and installation of a full suite of custom interior metal fixtures for a high-end residential renovation. The project included a basement bar shelf, a floating glass shelf system in the dining area, two metal/wood shelf units in the lounge, and three full-height mirror frames mounted floor-to-ceiling. Each piece was tailored to suit the architectural style of its space and required structural integrity, high finish quality, and seamless integration into the home.

skills: 
- SolidWorks
- Laser-cut part detailing and nesting awareness
- Tolerance planning and weld-access consideration
- Clean, concealed fastener design
- Bill of Materials creation and assembly sequencing
- Client communication and revision handling
- Fabrication coordination and quality control
- On-site problem solving and installer coordination
- Transportation handling and physical installation support
- Interpretation of interior design intent and translation into technical drawings

## Background & Objective
The design firm managing the renovation provided conceptual references for a series of interior fixtures, which I was responsible for transforming into detailed, manufacturable SolidWorks designs. The goal was to deliver a set of furniture-grade metal units that combined functionality, minimalism, and material richness (brass finishes, wood inserts), and to coordinate them from concept approval through installation.

The goal was to produce:

- A modern, functional bar shelf in the basement
- A light, visually minimal floating glass shelf system for the dining area
- Two wood-accented shelving units for the lounge that blended industrial and natural materials
- Three full-height mirrors mounted floor-to-ceiling

## Design and Prototyping Process
### Basement Bar Shelf
- Constructed from laser-cut steel components and flat bar framing
- Wall-mounted and designed to support bottles and barware
- Hidden mounting brackets and smooth outer geometry to keep the appearance clean and modern
- Welds were placed strategically to reduce visual impact and simplify fabrication

### Dining Area Floating Glass Shelf Unit
- Fabricated from mismatched metal tubes, flat bars, and machined brackets
- Held four staggered glass shelves, giving a light, floating effect
- Internal supports and tight tolerances ensured the glass stayed level without visible hardware
- Precision joinery and clean lines required close collaboration with installers to align the unit perfectly during installation

### Lounge Area Wood & Metal Shelving Units
- Built from square tubing, flat bar, and laser-cut supports, these units combined metal frames with wooden shelves
- Designed for visual warmth while maintaining a structured, geometric look
- Metalwork was fabricated for a flush fit around the wood shelves without the use of visible fasteners

### Floor-to-Ceiling Mirror Frames
- Three mirror frames were designed to anchor to both the floor and ceiling using slim but rigid tubing
- The frame design ensured alignment without visible fasteners and left room for electrical or LED mounting if required
- Installation demanded precision to ensure the frames were level, plumb, and flush against surrounding finishes

## Installation Involvement
In addition to design and drawing work, I was personally involved in the delivery and installation of the final fixtures:

- Traveled to site with our companyâ€™s installer and shipper
- Helped unload and carry heavy fabricated units into place
- Worked hands-on with the installer to align, mount, and secure each unit, particularly the ceiling-tensioned mirror frames and large shelving structures
- Provided on-the-spot design clarification and adjustment recommendations where site conditions varied from expected plans

This installation experience helped me better understand the practical demands of mounting tolerances, ceiling/wall conditions, and the importance of clear drawing communication for installers.

## Outcomes & Impact 
- Delivered eight fully custom metal fixtures, each unique to its room and function
- Ensured real-world functionality and clean aesthetic integration
- Demonstrated ability to take ownership of a design from concept through fabrication and installation
- Reinforced the importance of cross-discipline communication between design, fabrication, and site trades
- Improved my future design detailing through first-hand installation feedback
