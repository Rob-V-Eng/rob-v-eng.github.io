title: Black+Blue Restaurant - Wine Wall, Entry Doors & Display Shelving
description:  I designed several high-impact metal features for Black+Blue, a premium steakhouse in Toronto’s Entertainment District. These included a set of grand antique bronze entrance and patio doors, a large wine display with an integrated rolling ladder, and custom liquor shelving mounted along a central bar column. I was responsible for the full CAD development and shop drawing package, coordinating revisions, and overseeing fabrication readiness.

## Background & Objective
The client (a design-build firm working with the restaurant group) provided us with general concepts for a range of prominent metal fixtures. The goal was to bring their design vision to life through functional, manufacturable engineering — while ensuring each unit could be produced, transported, and installed cleanly in a high-end hospitality setting.

As the mechanical designer assigned to this project, I was responsible for:

- Interpreting and translating conceptual sketches into complete SolidWorks models
- Creating detailed technical drawings for both client review and shop use
- Handling design revisions and final drawing submissions for approval
- Preparing full production packages including part breakdowns and weld details
- Collaborating with the shop floor on fabrication questions, assembly planning, and coating specifications

### 1. Grand Entrance and Patio Double Doors
#### Scope & Objective
Design a visually striking set of oversized metal entrance doors in keeping with the restaurant’s upscale interior style. The design direction aimed for a castle-like aesthetic using layered metals and visible rivets.

#### Design Details
- Doors constructed from laser-cut sheet metal, flat bars, and metal tubing
- Multiple layers and decorative patterns created a dimensional, hand-forged appearance
- Rivets were incorporated across both faces to enhance the traditional ironwork feel
- Mounting plate alignment, hardware support, and welding instructions were fully detailed in drawings
- Finished in dark antique bronze for a weathered, architectural look

### 2. Wine Display & Rolling Ladder System
#### Scope & Objective
Design and detail a large-scale, wall-mounted wine display with a built-in horizontal rolling ladder for access. The display had to showcase the client’s wine collection prominently while supporting full functional use.

#### Design Details
- Overall dimensions: 317" W × 177" H, comprising 7 rows × 7 columns of shelving
- Built from square metal tubing, flat bar, and laser-cut brackets
- Top-mounted horizontal rail system integrated for the ladder to roll across the full length
- Ladder and rail anchoring points were fully engineered for safe load-bearing and easy movement
- Shelving layout was modeled to ensure consistent spacing and easy bottle access
- Final assembly designed in sub-sections for transport and installation
- Finished in satin brass to match the restaurant’s interior fixtures

### 3. Column-Mounted Whiskey Shelf Frames
#### Scope & Objective
Design five decorative and functional liquor shelves to be mounted concentrically around a vertical column rising from the center of the bar area.

#### Design Details
- Shelves were square-shaped metal frames with a central opening to pass through the column
- Frames made from square tubing, reinforced with perimeter flat bars to support glass insets
- Custom round tubing guard rails added around the edges of each shelf to prevent bottles from falling
- Bracket and clamp points were placed to anchor the frames securely to the column without obstructing sightlines
- Designed for both visual appeal and bartender functionality
- Finished in satin brass, coordinated with the wine display unit for consistency

## My Involvement

For all three feature pieces, I was involved in every technical stage:

- Received concept designs from the client and extracted structural logic
- Built full 3D CAD assemblies in SolidWorks to ensure visual alignment and mechanical feasibility
- Submitted assembly drawings for client approval, incorporated revisions, and finalized detailing
- Generated individual part drawings and fabrication packages including BOMs, weld notes, cut lists, and hardware callouts
- Coordinated with fabricators to address design challenges during production (e.g. ladder track anchoring, rivet placement, weld prep)
- Ensured all finishes (satin brass, antique bronze) were compatible with design (drain holes)

## Outcomes & Impact 
- Delivered three complex, high-finish architectural fixtures tailored to the restaurant’s luxury interior
- Transformed design sketches into fully engineered, production-ready units
- Demonstrated ability to manage large welded assemblies, modular design, and surface finish coordination
- Strengthened communication across design, fabrication, and client teams
- Built a strong portfolio example of functional architectural metalwork at scale
