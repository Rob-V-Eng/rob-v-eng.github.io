title: Spring-Loaded Cutting Head
description:  To reduce wear and manual adjustment in the pelletizer cutting process, I redesigned the existing cutting head with a spring-loaded mechanism. This ensures constant blade pressure against the breaker head, improving blade lifespan and reducing downtime.

## Background & Objective
The original pelletizer blades wore quickly and required frequent manual adjustment to maintain blade-to-breaker head contact. The goal was to automate this adjustment and increase blade longevity. A worn-out pelletizer head is shown in Figure 1.

## Design and Prototyping Process
I began by disassembling the original cutting head from the pelletizer machine to fully understand its form and function. After carefully measuring all critical dimensions, I created a 3D model in SolidWorks. From there, I modified the design to incorporate a spring-loaded mechanism that would apply constant pressure to keep the blades flush against the breaker head.
Several design iterations were explored to ensure proper material compatibility, spring force optimization, and ease of assembly. Once finalized, the modified cutting head was fabricated and assembled as a prototype for testing. The Solidworks drawings and prototype is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.
