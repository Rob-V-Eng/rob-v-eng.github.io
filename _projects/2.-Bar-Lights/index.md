title: Bar Lights
description:  I designed and developed a set of four custom L-shaped bar lights for Bellwoods Brewery, delivered through a third-party design and fabrication firm. The lights were made from welded metal tubing, flat bars, and laser-cut plates, and finished in satin brass to match the brewery’s interior. I was responsible for translating the client's concept into a fully detailed SolidWorks model, creating fabrication drawings, coordinating client approvals, and supporting the production and quality check phases.

## Background & Objective
The client provided initial concept sketches for decorative yet functional lighting above the brewery’s bar counter. The lights needed to blend with the brewery’s modern industrial style, while also being practical to manufacture, wire, and install.

Each fixture was designed with an L-shaped metal tube arm, one end mounted to a wall and the other suspended or tensioned with a cable. Inside the tubing, electrical wiring would power the light sockets. The lights also needed to be cleanly finished with a satin brass coating to match the brewery’s existing aesthetic.

## Design and Prototyping Process
**1. Assembly & Mounting Strategy**
I began by modeling two fixture types in SolidWorks:

- **Assembly Type A:** Mounted to the wall at the vertical end, with a wire suspending the elbow to the ceiling for structural support.
- **Assembly Type B:** Also wall-mounted, but with the support wire running back to the same wall, forming a tensioned triangle.

This subtle difference in wire routing required careful attention to force direction, load path, and mounting plate geometry. I included reinforcement where needed, while keeping the design lightweight for easier installation.

**2. Design for Wiring & Fabrication**
Each tube housed electrical wiring, so I designed the tubing with:

- Pre-cut wiring access holes at junctions
- Laser-cut end caps and mounting plates
- Concealed welds and clean edges for a seamless finished look
- Adequate space inside bends for wire routing without pinch points

I specified weld type, weld locations, and weld accessibility in the drawings to ensure that the production team had clear, shop-floor-ready instructions.

**3. Client Review & Coordination**
- I submitted full assembly drawings for client approval.
- Incorporated feedback and minor design tweaks regarding mounting offsets and finish details.
- Upon approval, I created detailed part drawings and a complete fabrication package for release to the shop.
- I monitored key production steps and conducted a final quality check before the pieces were sent for satin brass finishing and delivery.

The assembly drawings are shown below:

The completed units are installed and suspended from the ceiling and wall, as shown in the images below. The full set of on-site pictures are shown at the bottom of this page.

## Outcomes & Impact 
- Delivered four unique lighting fixtures with precise fit, finish, and electrical integration
- Ensured visual consistency with the brewery’s design language through collaborative revision and finish matching
- Reduced installation time and risk by designing a clean, modular mounting approach
- Produced fabrication-ready drawings that minimized ambiguity for welders and fabricators
- Demonstrated full-cycle project execution, from concept interpretation to post-fabrication QA
