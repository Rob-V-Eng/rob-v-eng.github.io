title: Production Line Improvement Projects
description:  Throughout my tenure at IPEX, I worked on several hands-on design projects to improve material flow, equipment compatibility, and workplace safety across multiple production lines. These projects often required me to reverse-engineer existing components, design custom parts in SolidWorks, and collaborate with both engineering and shop floor teams. I focused on fast, effective designs that could be easily fabricated and installed using available resources.

# Dust Collector For Feeder Area 
## Overview 
To solve a persistent issue with dust and pellet overflow near a feeder, I designed a custom bowl-shaped collector with an integrated splitter. This solution improved material containment, feeder consistency, and safety in the area — all without requiring modifications to the existing equipment.

## Background & Objective
Operators were dealing with constant buildup of plastic pellets and fine dust around the feeder inlet. Material would spill over the edge of the hopper, collect in hard-to-clean corners, and cause slowdowns during production. This also created a tripping hazard and a contamination risk.

The team needed a way to funnel loose material cleanly into the feeder and eliminate the buildup, without reconfiguring the feeder system or purchasing new equipment.


## Design Process
1. Problem Identification & Site Walkthrough
I visited the line during operation and observed how the material was behaving. I took photos, spoke to operators, and learned that the material would bounce off the inlet edges and accumulate around the base.

Concept Sketching & CAD Modeling
Based on the flow pattern, I sketched a bowl-like design that would surround the feeder inlet. The curved geometry would naturally guide material toward the center.

In SolidWorks, I created a parametric model that could be easily adjusted for different hopper sizes.

The design had a flanged base for easy bolting to the existing frame, requiring no welding.

Flow Disruption Splitter
To prevent material from piling up inside the bowl itself, I added a splitter plate—a vertical fin that breaks up the flow and helps redistribute clumps of pellets more evenly.

Design for Fabrication
The model was created with standard sheet metal tools in SolidWorks, making it easy for the shop to manufacture with minimal waste or special tooling.

## Outcomes & Impact
Improved Cleanliness: Material that previously spilled onto the floor was now redirected into the feeder with ~90% efficiency, drastically reducing cleanup frequency.

Increased Safety: Reduced floor dust and spillage lowered slip risk in the area.

Boosted Operator Confidence: The system became more hands-off, so operators could focus on running the line, not managing spills.

Design Scalability: The parametric model could be reused or modified for other feeder setups with minimal effort.
