title: Production Line Improvement Projects
description:  Throughout my tenure at IPEX, I worked on several hands-on design projects to improve material flow, equipment compatibility, and workplace safety across multiple production lines. These projects often required me to reverse-engineer existing components, design custom parts in SolidWorks, and collaborate with both engineering and shop floor teams. I focused on fast, effective designs that could be easily fabricated and installed using available resources.

# Dust Collector For Feeder Area 
## Overview 
To reduce dust and pellet buildup near a feeder, I modified an existing hopper lid by adding a bowl-shaped funnel and internal splitter. This redesign improved material containment and flow, reduced cleanup time, and maintained compatibility with the original equipment.

## Background & Objective
Operators were dealing with constant buildup of plastic pellets and fine dust around the feeder inlet. Material would spill over the edge of the hopper, collect in hard-to-clean corners, and cause slowdowns during production. This also created a tripping hazard and a contamination risk.

The team needed a way to funnel loose material cleanly into the feeder and eliminate the buildup, without reconfiguring the feeder system or purchasing new equipment.

## Design Process
**1) Measurement & Reverse Engineering:** I removed the existing hopper lid and took detailed measurements of its diameter, bolt pattern, and overall geometry. This ensured any modified version would fit exactly into place without needing changes to the hopper body.

**2) 3D Redesign in SolidWorks:** Using SolidWorks, I recreated the lid model and then:
- Added a bowl-shaped attachment to direct material toward the center opening.
- Integrated a splitter fin into the funnel that would break up clumps and guide flow more evenly into the feeder.

**3) Design for Manufacturing:** I ensured the new design could be fabricated with minimal changes to the lid structure — bolt holes and lid sealing features were preserved. 

**4) Operator and Maintenance Input:** Before finalizing the design, I shared it with shop floor staff to confirm ease of use and cleaning.

## Outcomes & Impact
- Improved Cleanliness: Material that previously spilled onto the floor was now redirected into the feeder with ~90% efficiency, drastically reducing cleanup frequency.
- Increased Safety: Reduced floor dust and spillage lowered slip risk in the area.
- Boosted Operator Confidence: The system became more hands-off, so operators could focus on running the line, not managing spills.
- Design Scalability: The parametric model could be reused or modified for other feeder setups with minimal effort.


# Custom Adapters for Hopper-Feeder Gap
## Overview 
After a new motor was installed on a feeder system, the assembly’s height changed, leaving a vertical gap between the hopper and the feeder pipe. This caused spillage, disrupted material flow, and created unnecessary downtime. I designed and delivered custom adapter collars that perfectly bridged the gap and restored seamless operation — without needing to relocate or modify existing equipment.

## Background & Objective
During an equipment upgrade, a new motor was installed for the feeder, which had a different mounting height than the original one. As a result, the entire feeder assembly sat lower, creating a noticeable gap between the bottom of the hopper and the top of the feeder pipe.

This misalignment caused poor material transfer, increased spillage, and disrupted production. The challenge was to design a fast, cost-effective solution that bridged the gap, restored proper material flow, and fit within the existing layout — without needing to relocate equipment or redesign the motor mount.

## Design Process

**1) On-Site Assessment & Measurements:** I measured the vertical offset between the hopper and the feeder, and took diameter measurements for both ends. The solution had to be simple, reliable, and repeatable — as three different production lines were affected by the same issue.

**2) Adapter Geometry & Modeling:** I designed a tapered adapter sleeve in SolidWorks with:
- A smaller diameter at the top (to fit the hopper outlet)
- A larger diameter at the bottom (to match the feeder inlet)
- A smooth internal transition to avoid material hang-up or turbulence
- The design had no moving parts, no fasteners, and could be easily clamped or sealed into place using the existing assembly hardware.

**3) Standardization for Scalability:** Since the gap and pipe dimensions were identical across all three affected lines, I reused the same design for all units, allowing for batch fabrication and quick installation.

**4) Fabrication Readiness:** The model was optimized for machining or sheet metal forming, using standard pipe stock sizes to keep material costs low and turnaround time short.

## Outcomes & Impact
- **Restored Full Operation:** Material flow between hopper and feeder was immediately reestablished.
- **Quick Turnaround:** Designed, modeled, and delivered the adapters within a short timeframe, minimizing downtime.
- **Replicable Design:** One model served three lines — no adjustments were needed, which simplified fabrication and documentation.
- **Low-Cost, High-Impact:** Solved a system-level problem using a minimalist, robust design that required no additional controls or moving parts.


# Feeder Pipe Housing System
## Overview 
I designed and delivered two versions of a custom housing that connects two material inlets into one outlet feeding the production line. The first version was a sealed housing to route and contain material flow. The second version included additional top access with hinged lids, allowing operators to pour in material manually when needed. These designs improved material handling, flow reliability, and operator flexibility.

## Background & Objective
When I was assigned the task, the setup consisted of two separate pipes feeding into the line, but there was no proper housing or containment — just loosely arranged pipes with no clear connection or integration.

While I wasn’t provided the previous setup, it was clear from the open-ended nature of the pipes that material loss, dust, and inefficient flow were recurring issues. My objective was to create a modular housing that would:

- Cleanly join two incoming material sources into one outlet
- Prevent spillage or product loss
- Be easy to fabricate, install, and maintain
- (In version two) Allow manual top-up by operators without interrupting production

## Design Process
### Version 1: Basic Dual-Inlet Housing

**1) Measurement & Fitment Planning:** I measured the three involved pipes — two inlets and one outlet — and determined how they needed to converge while maintaining consistent flow. Spatial constraints and existing mounting brackets were factored into the design.

**2) CAD Modeling in SolidWorks:**

  I created a tri-ported housing with:
- Two angled inlets (left and right)
- A single outlet
- Smooth internal finish to reduce turbulence and ensure smooth materail flow
- Bolt-on flanges for quick mounting

**3) Fabrication-Ready Design:** Using sheet metal tools in SolidWorks, I ensured the model could be laser cut and bent with standard shop capabilities.

### Version 2: Pour-In Enabled Housing with Hinged Lids

**1) Operator-Driven Requirement**

Shortly after, I was asked to design a different housing — this time for a single pipe feeding into the line, but with the ability for operators to manually top up material during production.

**2) SolidWorks Design**

I modeled a cylindrical housing with:
- One inlet pipe feeding material in
- One outlet port aligned to the line
- A bowl-shaped opening on the top to act as a funnel
- A hinged metal lid with a handle to cover the bowl when not in use

The housing was compact and mounted vertically. I took care to angle the bowl opening to make pouring easier from a standing position.

**3) Ergonomics & Safety**

I consulted operators to make sure the height and opening size were practical. The lid was designed to stay closed with a magnetic catch to prevent accidental spills.

## Outcomes & Impact
- Improved Material Flow: The housings connected all pipes securely, reduced product loss, and promoted consistent merging of material into the line.
- Cleaner Work Environment: Eliminated spillage from open pipe ends, making the surrounding area safer and more professional.
- Operator Empowerment: The pour-in version gave staff more control, reducing downtime during material top-ups and changeovers.
- Adaptable Design: The two versions gave the team flexibility depending on the line’s specific needs — sealed vs. access-enabled.
- Fast Turnaround: Both designs were manufacturable in-house with existing shop equipment, keeping costs and delays to a minimum.


# Concept Design – Metal Separator
## Overview 
I developed a concept for a magnetic rod-based separator designed to fit inside a feeder pipe and capture metal contaminants before they reach downstream equipment. The goal was to create a passive, easy-to-install solution that could be manufactured in-house and maintained with minimal effort. While the design was not manufactured during my tenure, it demonstrated initiative and served as a proof of concept for future process improvements.

## Background & Objective
Occasional metal contamination — such as small bolts, screws, or shavings — was reported in the plastic pellet stream, posing a risk to sensitive feeder machinery and overall product quality. The engineering team was looking for simple, low-cost ideas that didn’t require expensive equipment or redesigning the system.

I took the initiative to propose a magnetic separator concept that could be installed directly inside the material feed pipe, allowing magnetic contaminants to be removed passively without interrupting normal flow.

## Design Process
**1) Research & Problem Exploration**
I reviewed reports of past contamination incidents and spoke with maintenance staff to understand the root causes. Most contaminants were ferrous, suggesting that a magnetic solution could work. The existing system offered no accessible way to intercept these particles.

**2) Concept Development in SolidWorks**

I designed a drop-in separator insert made up of:
- A round flange or ring to seat the unit within the feeder pipe
- Multiple horizontal neodymium magnetic rods to span the diameter of the pipe and intercept falling metal
- A handle or tab for easy insertion and removal during maintenance
- Clearance around the rods to allow uninterrupted flow of plastic pellets

**3) Material & Design Considerations**

I selected stainless steel encased magnets for safety and corrosion resistance, and designed the rest of the parts for sheet metal fabrication or CNC using shop-ready tools.

**4) Collaborative Feedback**

I reviewed the design informally with the engineering team, who confirmed its feasibility as a future improvement but chose not to implement it during my co-op term due to timing and production priorities.

## Outcomes & Impact
- Showcased Proactive Problem Solving: The project wasn’t assigned — I identified the issue and proposed a solution independently.
- Functional, Scalable Concept: Designed to be installed in any vertical feed pipe without requiring structural changes.
- Passive, No-Maintenance Operation: Concept relied on magnetic attraction rather than sensors or active systems.
- Low-Cost, In-House Manufacturable: Could be built using existing equipment and materials with minimal overhead.
- Positive Reception: While not implemented, the design was well received and retained for future consideration.
