title: Production Line Improvement Projects
description:  Throughout my tenure at IPEX, I worked on several hands-on design projects to improve material flow, equipment compatibility, and workplace safety across multiple production lines. These projects often required me to reverse-engineer existing components, design custom parts in SolidWorks, and collaborate with both engineering and shop floor teams. I focused on fast, effective designs that could be easily fabricated and installed using available resources.

# Dust Collector For Feeder Area 
## Overview 
To reduce dust and pellet buildup near a feeder, I modified an existing hopper lid by adding a bowl-shaped funnel and internal splitter. This redesign improved material containment and flow, reduced cleanup time, and maintained compatibility with the original equipment.

## Background & Objective
Operators were dealing with constant buildup of plastic pellets and fine dust around the feeder inlet. Material would spill over the edge of the hopper, collect in hard-to-clean corners, and cause slowdowns during production. This also created a tripping hazard and a contamination risk.

The team needed a way to funnel loose material cleanly into the feeder and eliminate the buildup, without reconfiguring the feeder system or purchasing new equipment.

## Design Process
**1. Measurement & Reverse Engineering:** I removed the existing hopper lid and took detailed measurements of its diameter, bolt pattern, and overall geometry. This ensured any modified version would fit exactly into place without needing changes to the hopper body.

**2. 3D Redesign in SolidWorks:** Using SolidWorks, I recreated the lid model and then:
- Added a bowl-shaped attachment to direct material toward the center opening.
- Integrated a splitter fin into the funnel that would break up clumps and guide flow more evenly into the feeder.

**3. Design for Manufacturing:** I ensured the new design could be fabricated with minimal changes to the lid structure — bolt holes and lid sealing features were preserved. 

**4. Operator and Maintenance Input:** Before finalizing the design, I shared it with shop floor staff to confirm ease of use and cleaning.

## Outcomes & Impact
- Improved Cleanliness: Material that previously spilled onto the floor was now redirected into the feeder with ~90% efficiency, drastically reducing cleanup frequency.
- Increased Safety: Reduced floor dust and spillage lowered slip risk in the area.
- Boosted Operator Confidence: The system became more hands-off, so operators could focus on running the line, not managing spills.
- Design Scalability: The parametric model could be reused or modified for other feeder setups with minimal effort.

# Custom Adapters for Hopper-Feeder Gap
## Overview 
After a new motor was installed on a feeder system, the assembly’s height changed, leaving a vertical gap between the hopper and the feeder pipe. This caused spillage, disrupted material flow, and created unnecessary downtime. I designed and delivered custom adapter collars that perfectly bridged the gap and restored seamless operation — without needing to relocate or modify existing equipment.

## Background & Objective
During an equipment upgrade, a new motor was installed for the feeder, which had a different mounting height than the original one. As a result, the entire feeder assembly sat lower, creating a noticeable gap between the bottom of the hopper and the top of the feeder pipe.

This misalignment caused poor material transfer, increased spillage, and disrupted production. The challenge was to design a fast, cost-effective solution that bridged the gap, restored proper material flow, and fit within the existing layout — without needing to relocate equipment or redesign the motor mount.

## Design Process
**1. On-Site Assessment & Measurements:** I measured the vertical offset between the hopper and the feeder, and took diameter measurements for both ends. The solution had to be simple, reliable, and repeatable — as three different production lines were affected by the same issue.

**2. Adapter Geometry & Modeling:** I designed a tapered adapter sleeve in SolidWorks with:
- A smaller diameter at the top (to fit the hopper outlet)
- A larger diameter at the bottom (to match the feeder inlet)
- A smooth internal transition to avoid material hang-up or turbulence
- The design had no moving parts, no fasteners, and could be easily clamped or sealed into place using the existing assembly hardware.

**3. Standardization for Scalability:** Since the gap and pipe dimensions were identical across all three affected lines, I reused the same design for all units, allowing for batch fabrication and quick installation.

**4. Fabrication Readiness:** The model was optimized for machining or sheet metal forming, using standard pipe stock sizes to keep material costs low and turnaround time short.

## Outcomes & Impact
- **Restored Full Operation:** Material flow between hopper and feeder was immediately reestablished.
- **Quick Turnaround:** Designed, modeled, and delivered the adapters within a short timeframe, minimizing downtime.
- **Replicable Design:** One model served three lines — no adjustments were needed, which simplified fabrication and documentation.
- **Low-Cost, High-Impact:** Solved a system-level problem using a minimalist, robust design that required no additional controls or moving parts.
