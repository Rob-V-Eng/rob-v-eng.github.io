title: 3D Facility Map
description:  Created a detailed 3D map of an area of an IPEX plant (the Blending department) to assess the feasibility of integrating new equipment within the space and to optimize layout planning. The map enables more efficient spatial planning and equipment coordination. The map also allows the rearrangement of existing equipment.

I created a full 3D map of the Blending Area to help plan equipment upgrades and rearrangements. It made it easy to see how new machines could fit into the space without interfering with existing equipment.

## Background & Objective  
The team was looking to add new machines to the Blending Area, but there wasnâ€™t a clear layout showing how much space was available. Equipment layout was planned using rough hand sketches and estimates, which made it difficult to visualize spacing and often led to installation issues

## Design Process
I took detailed measurements of all machines and open areas, then modeled everything to scale in SolidWorks. The 3D layout included spacing for walkways, maintenance access, and utility connections. The 3D map of the Bleding Area is shown in Figures 1-3:
