title: Tim Hortons-Sign Frame & Beverage Cart
description:  I designed and detailed two custom metal fixtures for a Tim Hortons kiosk: a sign frame that mounted above the serving area, and a mobile beverage cart with integrated cup storage and shelving. Both units were developed for functional daily use and to match Tim Hortons’ branded look. I translated the client’s initial concepts into manufacturable SolidWorks models, created production-ready shop drawings, and supported fabrication coordination.

## Background & Objective
The project’s goal was to produce fixtures that were:
- Visually aligned with Tim Hortons’ branding
- Durable enough for high-traffic commercial use
- Easy for employees to use, clean, and move as needed
- Simple to fabricate, assemble, and install on site

I was tasked with turning the client’s concept sketches and requirements into fully detailed engineering drawings, while ensuring that design, functionality, and fabrication requirements were met.

### Design Process
#### Sign Frame
- The frame was constructed from square metal tubing, designed to sit securely on top of the kiosk counter.
- Integrated a perforated sheet mesh backing — laser-cut to precise fit — providing a textured backdrop.
- Mounted individual metal letters spelling out "Tim Hortons" on top of the mesh. I designed alignment features for clean, consistent letter placement.
- Used flat bars and laser-cut plates to reinforce structural integrity while minimizing visual bulk.
- Considered how the sign frame would be fastened to the table top without visible hardware from the customer side — I provided hidden anchoring points in the drawing package.
- Created sub-assembly drawings for the frame, mesh panel, and letter mounting.

#### Beverage Cart
- Designed a compact mobile cart that slides neatly under the kiosk’s front counter when not in use.
- Frame built from square metal tubing, with internal shelves on the employee side for beverage supplies.
- Integrated precision-cut holes in the top deck sized to hold paper cups of different diameters (small, medium, large).
- Cart designed on caster wheels for easy movement — I specified wheel types and mounting methods in the drawings.
- Included clearances in the frame to prevent interference with the kiosk table legs or surrounding structure when stored.
- Developed all part and assembly drawings in SolidWorks, specifying weld types, joinery details, and BOM items.

## My Involvement

For both the sign frame and cart, I:

- Interpreted client sketches and requirements, refining rough concepts into precise CAD models
- Designed full assemblies in SolidWorks, accounting for structural strength, ease of fabrication, and installation practicality
- Submitted assembly drawings for client review and approval, incorporated feedback, and finalized technical packages
- Created detailed shop drawings, part drawings, BOMs, and weld plans
- Collaborated with our production team to address fabrication sequencing and finishing needs

## Outcomes & Impact 
- Delivered durable, functional fixtures that met Tim Hortons’ operational and aesthetic standards
- Ensured manufacturability and easy installation, reducing shop-floor confusion and site adjustment needs
- Provided solutions that balanced visual design with practical use — including clean branding integration on the sign frame and ergonomic storage on the cart
- Enhanced my experience designing for retail and high-volume service environments
