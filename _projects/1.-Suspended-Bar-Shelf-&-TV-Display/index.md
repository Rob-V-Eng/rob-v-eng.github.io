title: Suspended Bar Shelf & TV Display – Denny’s Restaurant
description:  I led the technical design and production detailing of a custom suspended bar shelf and TV display for a Denny’s restaurant. The unit was designed to hang above the bar workspace, providing shelving on the interior and TV mounting cavities on the customer-facing side. I translated the client's initial concept into a complete set of manufacturable SolidWorks drawings, coordinated design approvals, and prepared all component drawings for fabrication and finishing.

## Background & Objective
The client provided conceptual drawings for a ceiling-mounted unit that needed to be both functional and visually clean. On the employee-facing side, the unit required open shelving for bottles and bar supplies, while the customer-facing side needed four recessed cavities for flush-mounted TVs. The unit had to be sturdy, easy to install in sections, and visually match the interior aesthetic.

My role was to:

- Convert the client’s concept into full 3D and 2D drawings
- Ensure structural feasibility and ease of fabrication
- Break down the design into manageable sub-assemblies for mounting
- Detail all components for manufacturing, including custom features like TV wire routing

## Design and Prototyping Process
1. Interpreting Client Vision
I received basic concept sketches from the client, then recreated the unit in SolidWorks as a detailed 3D model. I maintained the design intent but refined proportions, spacing, and material selection to ensure the final product could be reliably fabricated and installed.

2. Sub-Assembly Structuring
Given the size and weight of the full unit, I divided it into four sub-assemblies, allowing it to be mounted in sections. This made transport, handling, and ceiling installation significantly safer and easier, and ensured precise alignment between modules.

3. Structural & Aesthetic Detailing

- The frame was built using welded square tubing and flat bars for support and mounting.
- Decorative metal mesh panels were added for visual texture and ventilation.
- Laser-cut metal sheets formed the back of the TV cavities and added clean finishes to exposed faces.
- I included wire pass-through holes in each TV cavity to allow hidden routing of cables and power connections.
- All parts were designed with matte black powder coating in mind, ensuring good weld clean-up and consistent surface finish.

4. Client Review & Revisions
I presented the complete SolidWorks model and drawings to the client for review, made several revisions based on feedback (mostly regarding mounting detail and spacing), and finalized the drawings for production once approved.

The assembly drawing for the unit is shown below:

5. Production Package Preparation
After sign-off, I created detailed part drawings and a complete bill of materials for fabrication. This included:

- Component drawings for laser cutting, welding, and bending
- Sub-assembly instructions for in-shop pre-assembly
- Notes for finish requirements (powder coat spec, prep notes)

The completed unit is installed and suspended from the ceiling at Denny’s, as shown in the image below.

## Outcomes & Impact 
- Delivered a highly functional and visually integrated unit that met both architectural and operational needs
- Reduced installation risk by dividing the unit into four sub-assemblies
- Ensured manufacturability and finish quality through detailed part drawings and attention to welding and coating processes
- Demonstrated full-scope project ownership, from CAD modeling to final fabrication handoff
- Client was satisfied with the final result, and the unit was delivered for powder coating and installation without issue
